### Module 3: Detect objects in images with the Custom Vision service

Object detection is a form of computer vision in which artificial intelligence (AI) agents can identify and locate specific types of object in an image or camera feed.

### Topic 1: Introduction

*Object detection* is a form of machine learning based computer vision in which a model is trained to **recognize individual types of object in an image**, and to **identify their location in the image**.

For example, consider the following image:

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/wwl-data-ai/detect-objects-images-custom-vision/media/produce.png)

An object detection model might be used to identify the individual objects in this image and return the following information:

Notice that an object detection model returns the following information:

- The *class* of each object identified in the image.

- The *probability score* of the object classification (which you can interpret as the confidence of the predicted class being correct)

- The coordinates of a *bounding box* for each object.

#### 1.1 Uses of object detection

Some sample applications of object detection include:

- Evaluating the safety of a building by looking for fire extinguishers or other emergency equipment.

- Creating software for self-driving cars or vehicles with *lane assist* capabilities.

- Medical imaging such as an MRI or x-rays that can detect known objects for medical diagnosis.
